# YourLocalBot!
### known as one of the greatest dragdev bots ever!

## A few opening notes...
So i made the bot open source as per the tradition of [DragDev Studios](https://dragdev.xyz). I never expected this many people to want the code for it so that they can use their own, or even learn from it.
First of all, THE TOKEN IS NOT A REAL TOKEN! if you remove the `.`s from it and decode it [here](https://www.base64decode.org/), you will kinda get a funny message.
Second, im fluent in spaghetti code. if thats an issue for you, i wouldn't recommend this.
Third, i don't understand half of this. i just write it and pray that it works. This code spans back from the discord.py early rewrite alpha builds, and was last updated on to discord.py `1.2.3`.
Finally: if you decide to run your own version of this bot, i request that you give me some sort of credit somewhere in the bot. even if its as simple as putting the [website url (https://dragdev.xyz)](https://dragdev.xyz). thanks.

## Running your own
Now many people want to run their own local bot. **PLACEHOLDER< WIP**
